  ; different types of predicates:

  ; note: "constant substitution" feature = using a constant in 
  ; place of an output variable to act as a filter. 
  ; Already used in a previous example.

;;;7 -- workflow
;;;;

; Not obvious how to gracefully handly a cascalog workflow composed of a succession of many queries.
; I recommend looking into the 'checkpoint' contributed extension.
; The goal is to save intermediate results, allowing for more gracious failure and faster development.
; https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog-contrib/tree/master/cascalog.checkpoint
;
;
; In the author's words:
;
; The workflow macro in the checkpoint module allows you to break complicated
; workflows out into small, checkpointed steps. If one of these steps causes a
; job to fail and you restart the job, the workflow macro will skip every step
; up to the previous point of failure. Fault-tolerant MapReduce topologies ftw!



; That's it! Questions?
